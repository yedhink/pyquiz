1) Which of the following is an invalid assignment?
1) var = (22/22) + 1
2) var = (22/22.0) + 1
3) var = "22/22.0" + 1
4) var = "22/22.0" + "1"
3) TypeError since we are trying to concatanate a string and an integer

2) What is the output of print str[2:5] if str = 'Hello World!'?(take _ as blank space)
1) llo_
2) ello
3) ell
4) llo
4) It will print characters starting from 3rd to 5th. Output would be llo.

3) print(bool("true")) if "hello" == "Hello".lower() else print("false") . Output?
1) True
2) true
3) false
4) will result in error
1) "Hello".lower() would convert "Hello" to "hello" which makes the if condition true and bool("true") is True

4) What is the purpose of // operator?
1) divides twice
2) divides once and the quotient without the decimal part is taken
3) operator does not exist in python
4) it's equivalent to modulo operator(%) from other languages 
2) this is simply floor division,used when we have to remove the decimal part

5) Which of the following is invalid?
1) "print((22/22) + 1)" prints 2.0
2) "print((22/22.0) + 1)" prints 2.0
3) "print((22//22.0) + 1)" prints 2
4) "print((22.0//22.0) + 1)" prints 2
4) Although it's floor division, both the numbers are in floating point. so result too would be float,ie:- 2.0

6) Which of the following is not a common python framework?
1) flask
2) django
3) angular
4) dash
3) Angular is a javascript web framework

7) if my_list = [1,"abc"], then output of print(2*my_list)
1) [2,"abcabc"]
2) [1,'abc',1,'abc']
3) [[1,"abc"],[1,"abc"]]
4) TypeError since the list contains "abc"(string type) and we are trying to multiply 2(int type)
2) the content gets replicated n-number of times. here n = 2

8) How will you check in a string that all characters are alphanumeric?
1) using isAlNum()
2) using isalnum()
3) using isalpha()
4) no direct method available in python
2) isalnum() is the correct answer

9) What is the output of L[-2] if L = [1,4,2,3]?
1) 2
2) 1
3) [2,3]
4) Negative indexes are not possible
1) since negative indexes starts indexing from end to beginning and the 2nd one is 2

10) Which of these methods can output a reversed list from mylist=[1,2,3]?
1) list.reverse()
2) [i for i in range(len(mylist),0,-1)]
3) mylist[::-1]
4) all of the above.
4) all are correct and slicing is my favourite. there are other methods like reversed(mylist) too.
